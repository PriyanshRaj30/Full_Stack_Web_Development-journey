# JavaScript Cheat Sheet

## Variables and Data Types

- **Variables**: JavaScript provides two ways to declare variables: `let` and `const`. The `let` keyword is used for variables that can be reassigned, while the `const` keyword is used for variables that are meant to be constant and cannot be reassigned.
- **Data Types**: JavaScript has several primitive data types, including `string` (text), `number` (numeric values), `boolean` (true/false), `null` (represents the absence of value), and `undefined` (represents an uninitialized variable). Additionally, JavaScript has `object` (a collection of key-value pairs) and `array` (an ordered collection of values) as complex data types.

## Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators**: JavaScript provides arithmetic operators such as `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulus).
- **Assignment Operators**: JavaScript has assignment operators such as `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`. They are used to assign values to variables and perform the operation in shorthand.
- **Comparison Operators**: JavaScript has comparison operators such as `==` (equality), `===` (strict equality), `!=` (inequality), `!==` (strict inequality), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to). These operators compare two values and return a boolean result.
- **Logical Operators**: JavaScript includes logical operators such as `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT). They are used to combine multiple conditions and evaluate boolean expressions.

## Control Flow

- **Conditional Statements**: JavaScript provides `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for conditional execution of code blocks based on certain conditions.
- **Looping Statements**: JavaScript has `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops for executing a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met.
- **Switch Statement**: The `switch` statement allows you to perform different actions based on different conditions. It is often used as an alternative to multiple `if` statements.
- **Ternary Operator**: The ternary operator (`condition ? expression1 : expression2`) is a shorthand way to write conditional statements and return one of two expressions based on the result of the condition.

## Functions

- **Defining Functions**: In JavaScript, functions are defined using the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. The code to be executed is enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- **Function Parameters**: Functions can have parameters (input values) defined within the parentheses. These parameters can be used within the function to perform specific operations.
- **Return Statement**: The `return` statement is used to specify the value that a function should return when it is called. It ends the execution of the function and sends the specified value back to the calling code.
- **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions (`(param1, param2) => { // code }`) provide a concise syntax for defining functions. They are often used when passing anonymous functions as arguments or when a shorter function syntax is desired.

## Arrays

- **Creating Arrays**: Arrays in JavaScript can be created using either the `[]` syntax or the `new Array()` constructor.
- **Accessing Elements**: Elements within an array can be accessed using square brackets `[]` with the index of the element. Indexing starts from 0, so the first element

 is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
- **Array Methods**: JavaScript provides various built-in methods to manipulate arrays, such as `push()` (add element to the end), `pop()` (remove element from the end), `shift()` (remove element from the beginning), `unshift()` (add element to the beginning), `splice()` (modify array by adding/removing elements), `slice()` (extract a portion of an array), `concat()` (combine arrays), `join()` (create a string from array elements), `indexOf()` (find the index of an element), `includes()` (check if an element exists in the array), `sort()` (sort array elements), and `reverse()` (reverse the order of array elements).

## Objects

- **Creating Objects**: Objects in JavaScript can be created using either the curly braces `{}` or the `new Object()` constructor.
- **Accessing Properties**: Properties within an object can be accessed using dot notation (`objectName.propertyName`) or square brackets (`objectName['propertyName']`).
- **Object Methods**: JavaScript provides built-in methods to work with objects, such as `Object.keys()` (returns an array of object keys), `Object.values()` (returns an array of object values), and `Object.entries()` (returns an array of key-value pairs).

## Error Handling

- **Try...Catch Statement**: The `try...catch` statement is used to catch and handle errors in JavaScript. The `try` block contains the code that might throw an error, and the `catch` block handles the error if it occurs. The `catch` block takes an `error` parameter that represents the error object.

## DOM Manipulation

- **Selecting Elements**: JavaScript can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to select HTML elements using `document.querySelector()` or `document.querySelectorAll()`.
- **Modifying Elements**: JavaScript provides various methods to modify element content, such as `element.textContent` (sets or returns the text content of an element), `element.innerHTML` (sets or returns the HTML content of an element), `element.setAttribute()` (sets the value of an attribute), and `element.style.property` (sets or returns the value of a CSS property for an element).
- **Adding/Removing Classes**: Classes can be added or removed from elements using methods like `element.classList.add()`, `element.classList.remove()`, and `element.classList.toggle()`.
- **Event Listeners**: JavaScript allows attaching event listeners to elements using `element.addEventListener('event', callback)`. The callback function is executed when the specified event occurs.

## Asynchronous JavaScript

- **Promises**: Promises are used for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises are created using the `new Promise()` constructor and can be chained using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` methods.
- **Async/Await**: Async/await is a modern syntax for writing asynchronous JavaScript code. The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected.
